#### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide more information about temperature trends, specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

#### Results
..* The average temperature in June using data from a 7 year period is 75°F
..* The lowest temperature in June using data from a 7 year period is 64°F

#### Summary
I believe that it is feasable to run a successful surf and ice cream year round based on the average temperatures in June and December. Before committing to that I would also want to know how often the tempertatures drop below 65°F, so I would run queries in for June and December to answer that. I would also run queries to determine the rate of precipitation for those months and if and how it corresponds to the temperature. Is the chance of rain high on the colder days? If it is cold and raining that may affect how many people would come out for ice cream. However it is Hawaii, and it may rain more when it's warm, so people may be out and about in the rain.
